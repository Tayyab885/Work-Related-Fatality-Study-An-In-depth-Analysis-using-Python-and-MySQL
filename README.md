# Work-Related Fatality Study: An In-depth Analysis using Python and MySQL

This project involves an in-depth analysis of fatal incidents that occurred in various workplaces using a real-world dataset. The main objective is to clean and preprocess the data, analyze the dataset, and extract meaningful insights using Python and MySQL.

## Data Preprocessing Steps

The data preprocessing phase will consist of the following tasks:

1. Clean Data: Remove unrelated columns from the dataset to focus on relevant information.

2. Understand Data: Gain insights into the dataset by exploring its structure and characteristics.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and trends in the data.

4. Export to Excel: Save the cleaned and analyzed dataset into an Excel file for further use and sharing.

## Analysis using SQL

The SQL analysis phase will encompass the following tasks:

Task #1: Calculate the Total Number of Incidents
- Determine the total number of incidents reported in the given dataset.

Task #2: Total Fatalities with Citations
- Calculate the total number of fatalities that received a citation.

Task #3: Day of the Week Analysis
- Identify the day of the week with the highest number of fatalities and calculate the percentage (rounded to two decimal places) of fatalities reported on that day.

Task #4: Fatalities during Welding
- Calculate the total number of fatalities during welding incidents.

Task #5: Last 5 Welding Fatalities
- Identify and list the details of the last five fatalities related to welding incidents.

Task #6: Top 5 States with Most Fatal Incidents
- Determine the top five states that have experienced the highest number of fatal incidents.

Task #7: Top 5 States with Most Stabbing Incidents
- Identify the top five states with the highest number of fatal incidents caused by stabbing.

Task #8: Top 10 States with Most Shooting Incidents
- Find the top ten states with the highest number of fatal incidents caused by shooting.

Task #9: Total Shooting Deaths Each Year
- Calculate the total number of deaths caused by shooting for each year.

Task #10: Year-to-Year Fatality Percentage Changes
- Calculate the percentage changes (rounded to the nearest whole number) in the number of fatalities for each incident year, excluding the year 2022.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the "Work-Related Fatality Study" project aims to analyze real-world workplace fatality data using Python and MySQL. Through data preprocessing and SQL analysis, meaningful insights can be derived, allowing for a deeper understanding of work-related incidents and their patterns. The tasks provided above serve as a foundation for exploring and drawing conclusions from similar datasets in the field of workplace safety and fatality research, assisting professionals and researchers in making informed decisions to enhance workplace safety measures.
